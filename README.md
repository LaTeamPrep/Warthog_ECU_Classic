# Warthog_ECU_Classic
  - DIY after market ECU based on the Speeduino V0.3 board (ongoing design, fabrication & testing).

  - The WARTHOG Classic is a credit card size ECU designed primarily for Classic Mini engines,
  - but can also run 4 port injector with single CAM sensor, no VVT engines
  - (in paired injectors mode & wasted spark).
  - Due to the very small form factor some features have been droped for some others,
  - therefor it lakes a VR conditionner and also knock and flex iinputs.
  -
  - Here are the available INPUTS & OUTPUTS
  -
  - INPUTS
  - Battery positive
  - Battery negative
  - ACC
  - TPS, IAC, CLS, CAM, CRANK, O2
  - Onbaord MAP & Baro sensors
  -
  - OUTPUTS
  - 2 High amperage low impedance injectors drivers
  - 2 High amperage COP drivers
  - 2 IAC outputs
  - 1 High amperage fuel pump direct driver (no fuse no relay needed)
  - 1 High amperage fan direct driver (no fuse no relay needed)
  - 1 Boost output
  - 1 Tacho output

  - The WARTHOG ECU familly will all embarque a "no fuse no relay power management" startegy,
  - a clear front face and an aluminum back as sifgnature.
